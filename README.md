# CheckersGUI
As part of the MYP Grade 10 Computer Science course, I have created a graphical user interface in Java, 
using the built-in Swing library, for the game of Checkers. It is a 2-player game and includes 2 modes; A "Timed Mode" 
(Timer for 30 minutes to play) and an "Unlimited Mode" (play for as long as needed). Other than that, other features includes,
music, a login page with a username & password, and much more!

THE ONLY RELEVANT FILES TO DOWNLOAD ARE: 
1. The images (png's, jpg's, gif's, etc.)
2. The '.java' files (There is no point in downloading the other files (.ctxt, etc.)).
3. The music file (Music.wav).

This code can be run in which ever JDE is preferred, however, this game was made using BlueJ's JDE.
